Sudoku Game in Python

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Sudoku game, played directly in the terminal. The game is split into two files: one containing the code and the other for playing the game.
Features

    Terminal-based Gameplay: The game is played entirely in the terminal, with users entering numbers to fill in the Sudoku grid.
    Sudoku Validation: Ensures the game follows the traditional Sudoku rules, with no repeated numbers in rows, columns, or subgrids.

Files

    jeuSudoku.py: Contains the core logic of the Sudoku game, including the game setup and validation.
    d4q4.py: The file where users can play the game by interacting with the terminal.

How to Play

    To play the game, run the d4q4.py file:

    The game will display a Sudoku board with some pre-filled numbers.

    Enter numbers to fill the empty cells.

    The game will validate your moves, ensuring the rules of Sudoku are followed.
